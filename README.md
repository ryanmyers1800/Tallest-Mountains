This Website displays the ten tallest mountains in the United States. The mountains are listed in order from tallest to shortest. The list of mountains is displayed using a loop which iterates data generated from an array. There are two media queries which have been used to provide breakpoints for responsive navigation at the top of the page. There is a form to submit an email address to become the recipient of a newsletter, and that form contains responses for both valid and invalid email address submissions.

requirements met:
    1) Mobile first design.
    2) Responsive navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at mobile and desktop sizes.
    3) Validate email form, and display a thank you message upoon entering a valid email address. A message to let the user know they have entered an invalid email address along with a link to the home page is also implemented.
    4) Create and populate a JavaScript array, and display that information on the page (the list of mountains).
    5) Utilize two separate media queries to create breakpoints which make the site more user friendly.
