This Website will display the ten tallest mountains in the United States. The Mountains are listed in order from tallest to shortest. The list of mountains is displayed using a loop which takes data from an array of objects.  There are two media queries which have been used to provide breakpoints for responsive navigation at the top of the page; so that the navigation is easier to view at different viewport sizes.
